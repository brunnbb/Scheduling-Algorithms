# Scheduling-Algorithms
This project is a university assignment that involves simulating various scheduling algorithms of an operating system. The simulation analyzes a set of tasks provided through a JSON file input, performing the following tasks for each scheduling algorithm (FCFS, Round Robin, Rate Monotonic, and Earliest Deadline First):

    FCFS (First Come First Served) Simulation:
        Describe the sequence of task execution.
        Calculate the system utilization level.
        Calculate the average turnaround time for each task and the system.
        Calculate the average waiting time for each task and the system.
        Identify tasks with the highest and lowest average waiting time.
        Detect any task suffering from starvation.

    Round Robin Simulation:
        Describe the sequence of task execution.
        Calculate the system utilization level.
        Calculate the average turnaround time for each task and the system.
        Calculate the average waiting time for each task and the system.
        Identify tasks with the highest and lowest average waiting time.
        Detect any task suffering from starvation.
        Identify tasks involved in priority inversion and the moment it occurs.

    Rate Monotonic Simulation:
        Perform schedulability test for the task set and present the result.
        Describe the sequence of task execution.
        Calculate the system utilization level.
        Calculate the average turnaround time for each task and the system.
        Calculate the average waiting time for each task and the system.
        Identify tasks with the highest and lowest average waiting time.
        Detect any task suffering from starvation.
        Identify tasks involved in priority inversion and the moment it occurs.
        Identify tasks missing their deadlines, the moment it occurs, and the frequency (ratio of task activations to deadline misses).

    Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Simulation:
        Perform schedulability test for the task set and present the result.
        Describe the sequence of task execution.
        Calculate the system utilization level.
        Calculate the average turnaround time for each task and the system.
        Calculate the average waiting time for each task and the system.
        Identify tasks with the highest and lowest average waiting time.
        Detect any task suffering from starvation.
        Identify tasks involved in priority inversion and the moment it occurs.
        Identify tasks missing their deadlines, the moment it occurs, and the frequency (ratio of task activations to deadline misses).
